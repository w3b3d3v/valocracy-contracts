## Additional Test Scenarios

### Asset Transfer Scenarios
- Direct asset transfers to Treasury
  - Test behavior when assets are sent directly to Treasury without deposit
  - Verify share representation remains accurate
  - Check totalAssets() calculation after direct transfers
  - Validate share price impact from unexpected asset inflows

- External asset movements
  - Test Treasury's behavior when assets are moved externally
  - Verify share-to-asset ratio remains consistent
  - Check handling of unexpected asset outflows
  - Validate totalAssets() accuracy after external movements

### Recommended Test Cases
