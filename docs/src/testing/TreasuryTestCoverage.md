# Valocracy Treasury Test Coverage Report

## Overview

This document outlines the test coverage for the Valocracy Treasury system implemented as an ERC4626 vault. The tests verify the functionality of asset management, share minting, and withdrawal operations in the Valocracy ecosystem.

## Test Environment

- Uses Foundry for testing
- Deploys contracts:
  - Treasury (ERC4626 vault implementation)
  - MockToken (ERC20 implementation for testing)
  - Valocracy (main contract)
- Uses multiple test accounts:
  - DEPLOYER
  - VALOCRACY
  - USER1
  - USER2

## Test Categories

### 1. Contract Initialization

- **Contract Deployment**
  - Function Calls:
    - `new Treasury(asset_, valocracy, name, symbol)`
    - `name()`
    - `symbol()`
  - Verifies correct contract initialization
  - Validates token name and symbol
  - Checks asset and valocracy address assignment

- **Asset Configuration**
  - Function Calls:
    - `asset()`
  - Tests underlying asset assignment
  - Verifies asset token address

### 2. Asset Management

- **Asset Tracking**
  - Function Calls:
    - `totalAssets()`
    - `previewWithdraw(shares)`
  - Tests total assets calculation
  - Verifies share-to-asset conversion
  - Validates asset balance tracking
  - Uses MockToken to simulate real ERC20 assets

### 3. Share Operations

- **Share Minting**
  - Function Calls:
    - `deposit(receiver, shares)`
  - Tests share minting by Valocracy
    - Verifies only Valocracy can mint
    - Validates share distribution
    - Checks Deposit event emission
    - Uses MockToken for asset deposits

- **Share Burning**
  - Function Calls:
    - `withdraw(receiver, shares)`
  - Tests share burning and asset withdrawal
    - Verifies share burning
    - Validates asset transfer
    - Checks Withdraw event emission
    - Uses MockToken to track asset transfers

### 4. Access Control

- **Authorization Checks**
  - Function Calls:
    - `deposit(receiver, shares)` (from non-Valocracy address)
  - Tests deposit authorization
  - Verifies NotAuthorized error
  - Validates access restrictions

## Test Implementation Details

### MockToken Usage
- Implements ERC20 standard for testing
- Simulates any ERC20 asset that could be managed by the Treasury
- In real scenarios, this could be any ERC20 token like USDC, DAI, etc.
- Provides controlled environment for testing asset management

### Test Scenarios

#### Contract Setup
- Initialize treasury with correct parameters
- Verify asset and valocracy assignments
- Check token metadata

#### Asset Management
- Track total assets
- Verify share-to-asset conversions
- Test asset balance updates
- Validate MockToken integration

#### Share Operations
- Mint shares through Valocracy
- Burn shares and withdraw assets
- Verify share distribution
- Test share calculations
- Validate asset transfers

#### Access Control
- Verify Valocracy-only minting
- Test unauthorized deposit attempts
- Validate withdrawal permissions

#### Event Tracking
- Monitor Deposit events
- Monitor Withdraw events
- Verify event parameters
- Test event emission

## Test Coverage Status

The current test suite provides comprehensive coverage for:
1. ✅ Contract initialization and configuration
2. ✅ Asset tracking and balance management
3. ✅ Share minting and burning operations
4. ✅ Asset withdrawal and transfer
5. ✅ Access control and permissions
6. ✅ Event emission and tracking
7. ✅ Share-to-asset conversion calculations

## Future Considerations

The following aspects could be considered for future test coverage:
1. Share price calculations
2. Fee management
3. Emergency pause functionality
4. Asset strategy implementation
5. Treasury manager role
6. Additional access control features
7. Advanced withdrawal strategies
